# VirtualDJ Visual Studio Example
I just created my first VirtualDJ SDK plugin and was surprised no one had uploaded one to Github to make it easy for others to get started. So here's my first attempt, consider it a "Hello World", it's a DSP (Audio) Effect Plugin using Visual Studio which just mutes the left channel when the effect is applied.

If you want to create it from scratch follow the guide I followed:

Which uses the code from here:
